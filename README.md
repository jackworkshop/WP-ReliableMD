## brief introduction

A reliable, beautiful and powerful markdown plug-in of WordPress supports editing and rendering. It is developed to replace [WPEditor.md](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-editormd/) editor and become the next generation of markdown editor.

It is developed based on the block editor, trying to make great use of the powerful extensibility brought by the block editor, here I would like to express my thanks to the block editor developers of wordpress.

Editor is under development, not officially released, not recommended
